# Stop The Shark: A C++ Terminal-Based Word-Guessing Game

**Stop The Shark** is an intricate terminal game, architectured using C++, that adapts the traditional hangman game's mechanics with a thematic twist. The core logic intricately interweaves string manipulation, loop constructs, and random number generation to offer an engaging gameplay experience.

## Overview:

Players are tasked with deciphering a beach-themed word, represented initially by underscores. Each incorrect guess intensifies the game's narrativeâ€”indicating the shark's progression towards the beach. The culmination occurs when the player either successfully discerns the word or the shark metaphorically reaches the beach.

## Key Technical Features:

- **Dynamic Word Selection**: The game employs the C++ Standard Library's pseudo-random number generation facilities, seeded with the current time, ensuring diverse word selection across multiple sessions.

- **String Manipulation**: At its core, the game heavily leverages C++ string manipulation capabilities to dynamically update and display the current game state based on player input.

- **Loop Constructs**: The game flow is regulated through nested loop constructs, ensuring fluid progression and intuitive replayability.

- **Encapsulation**: Game data, like the beach-themed words and shark progression messages, is stored within STL containers, promoting modular and maintainable code structure.

## Compilation and Execution:

1. **Prerequisites**: Ensure your system is equipped with a C++11 compliant compiler. The game has been developed and tested using `g++`.

2. **Compilation**:
   To transform the source code into an executable, use the following command:
   ```
   g++ -std=c++11 stop_the_shark.cpp -o stop_the_shark
   ```

3. **Execution**:
   After successful compilation, the game can be initiated by executing the following command in the terminal:
   ```
   ./stop_the_shark
   ```

## Future Improvements:

- **Difficulty Levels**: Introduce various difficulty tiers that adjust the number of tries or the complexity of the words.

- **Graphical Interface**: Transition from a terminal-based interface to a more visually engaging graphical user interface (GUI).

- **Themed Word Packs**: Allow players to choose different themes beyond just the beach, such as forest, cityscape, or space.

- **Multiplayer Mode**: Implement a two-player mode where one player chooses the word and the other player guesses.

- **Hint System**: Incorporate a hint mechanism where players can sacrifice a turn to get a clue related to the word.
